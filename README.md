A modern, secure, and high-contrast **Contact Form Interface** built for **VyomGarud Systems**, a UAV / drone technology company specializing in mission-grade aerial systems.

## 🛰️ Overview

This project is a **production-ready React component** that represents the **“Contact” section** of the VyomGarud landing page.  
It features a minimal, authoritative design with subtle motion effects powered by **Framer Motion**, optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences using **Tailwind CSS**.

The form emphasizes **confidentiality, focus, and simplicity** — key traits for defense and aerospace-oriented UI design.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters **Organization / Unit Name**, **Email**, and **Mission Requirements**.  
2. Form validates all fields before submission.  
3. You can integrate backend logic or APIs later to:
   - Send secure form data to your server or email endpoint.
   - Trigger notifications or save entries in a database.
